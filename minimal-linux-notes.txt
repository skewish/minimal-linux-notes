**for minimal-linux-new

"disable" locations within the "make menuconfig" menus
(feel free to disable anything else you don't need)
(however, those listed should be disabled)

within linux's make menuconfig:

disable loadable modules and DRM

location:
-> Enable loadable module support (CONFIG_MODULES [=n])
	
location:
-> Device Drivers
	-> Graphics support
		-> Direct Rendering Manager (CONFIG_DRM [=n])

within busybox make menuconfig:

disable tc

location:
-> Networking Utilities
	-> tc (CONFIG_TC [=n])

also, make menuconfig will not work for busybox with Debian 13
you must edit the following file in busybox source code to fix it:

~/scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/check-lxdialog.sh
Line 50
add "int" to the beginning of the line

example, change:

#include CURSES_LOC
main() {}

to:

#include CURSES_LOC
int main() {}

make menuconfig will then work
